What is the Lyrean Companion App:
The Lyrean Companion App (LCA for short) is a comprehensive web application that players can use to look up monsters, NPCs, store characters, review character sheets, and see their inventories. It will feature a search functionality, display details about characters, NPCs, and monsters, have accounts associated with each user, sort and filter based on tags, and have basic social features such as posting messages to their "feed" on a profile page.
